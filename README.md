   `9. Ground Texture: https://polyhaven.com/a/concrete_rock_path`

II. **Functionality**. The functionalities of the game and usage of it are described as follows.

   `1. Laser Pointer: When pressing the by_button on the right controller, the laser pointer will appear. When the laser hovers on a button, pressing the trigger button on the right controller will trigger button click events.`

   `2. Grab: The user can use the grip button on either hand to grab the pickable object.`

   `3. Mission Board: The user can press the by_button on the left controller to invoke the mission board and choose your mission.`

   `4. Health Bar: The user and monsters will have a health bar on the head. When the user uses a pickable weapon to hit the monster, the monster's health will be decreased accordingly. When the monster collides with the user, the user's health will also be decreased accordingly. Health equals 0 means death. When the monster dies, a new monster will be generated. When the user dies, a death prompt will be shown and the mission progress will be clear, then the user will be sent back to the main base.`

   `5. Portal: There will be portals at the main base navigating to outer lands. When the portal is working, there will be a countdown. After the user completes the mission, the portal at the outer land will be activated, which allows the user to come back. When the user completes a mission at an outer land, the next level will be unlocked. When the user unlocks all portals, the game is over.`
